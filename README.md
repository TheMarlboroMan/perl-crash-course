#Fun with perl.

A few Perl scripts whose purpose is to teach the essentials of the language to 
people who already know about coding. It covers Perl 5 and has been tested
with perl 5.16.3.

#Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge about coding is required (what are control flow structures,
	what are functions, what is a class, what is an operator, what are
	escape sequences...).

- Basic knowledge about data types is required (what is a string, what is a 
	number, what is an array, what is a map, what is an instance...).

- Basic knowledge about filesystems and streams is required (what is a file,
	what is the standard input/output...).

#Why Perl?

And why not? Despite its age, Perl is still widely used and actively developed.
The more languages we know, the more tools we have at our disposal!. Even the
minimal notions about any language are better than no notions at all, not only
for our resum√© but also for our critical thinking capabilities, memory and 
general attitude towards life (for real).

#Using strict and warnings in Perl:

Always, always, always, always use string and use warnings. There's no point in
not doing so.

In fact, whatever language you develop in, please, turn reporting to the max
(hint, hint, PHP, hint, hint), use the most strict subset possible and treat
warnings as if they were errors. You will be glad you did, not today, nor
tomorrow, but some day.

#A word of warning.

Some idioms, functions and ways of doing things are introduced as the scripts
go. For example, the use of parentheses when calling functions is very strict
in the first script, but soon we get to call "print" using comma separated 
arguments, skipping parentheses and mixing with calls in between.

#Disclaimer.

I am no Perl monk or wizard. Perhaps I am a novice in training. Take these 
scripts as a way to do quick diving into the language and follow by reading 
specialized materials.
